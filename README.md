# Low-Power-Instruction-Scheduling
- Reduce energy consumption of embedded processors by re-ordering assembly instructions. The project was written in C using CodeBlock IDE.
- The program analyzes assembly code to build the instruction dependency graph.
- Then a genetic algorithm (proposed by me) is used to re-order assembly instructions based on the dependency graph with the objective to reduce the energy. 
- All the code was written in C in Linux environment.
